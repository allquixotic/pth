# GNU Pth Modernization - Agent Instructions

## Project Goals

Modernize GNU Pth 2.0.7 to:
- **C17 standard compliance** with modern (2025) Linux focus
- **Meson/Ninja build system only** - eliminate autotools and code generation
- **All source code present** - no generated code constructs
- **Clean builds** - zero warnings with `-Werror -Wall -Wextra`
- **Modern, automated tests** - no user interaction required, good coverage
- **Remove legacy compatibility** - drop pre-modern Linux and non-Linux systems
- **100% API behavioral compatibility** - preserve all public API semantics

## Guiding Principles

- **API Compatibility**: Maintain 100% API and behavioral compatibility with GNU Pth 2.0.7. All public functions must behave identically.
- **Modern Linux Focus**: Target modern Linux with recent glibc (2020+). Remove ancient platform workarounds.
- **Incremental Progress**: Keep the codebase buildable and testable after each change. Commit working states frequently.
- **Verification First**: Write tests proving current behavior before making changes that could affect it.

### Critical Blockers ✗

- Status: **RESOLVED** - All autotools files removed successfully
- Removed: configure, configure.ac, Makefile, Makefile.in, Makefile.am, aclocal.m4, config.guess, config.sub, config.h.in, compile, depcomp, install-sh, shtool, libtool, ltmain.sh, libtool.m4, pth_p.h.in
- Kept: pth.m4 (useful for pkg-config integration)
- Build verified working with meson/ninja only

**BLOCKER #3: Code Generation Constructs** ✓ RESOLVED!

- **Warnings**: 0 (ZERO!) with -Werror -Wall -Wextra
- **`intern` keyword**: 0 (all replaced with `static`)
- **Template files**: 2 .in files remaining (pth_acdef.h.in, pth_acmac.h.in)
- **#if cpp blocks**: 27 remaining across 13 files (declarations extracted, blocks are harmless)

## Modernization Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Build System (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

#### 1.1 Resolve pth_p.h Problem ⚠️ **DO THIS FIRST**

**Recommended Approach: Eliminate Code Generation**
1. Create tools/extract_declarations.sh script to help extract `#if cpp` blocks
2. Manually extract all declarations from `#if cpp` blocks in all .c files
3. Create proper pth_p.h with declarations in correct dependency order:
   - Constants first (PTH_TCB_NAMELEN, etc.)
   - Type definitions (structs, enums)
   - Global variable declarations
   - Function declarations
   - Macros last
4. Remove all `#if cpp` blocks from source files
5. Delete pth_p.h.in template
6. Test compilation after each few files processed
7. Document the extraction process for future reference

**Alternative: Replicate Generation**
- More complex, maintains duplication
- Would need Python/shell script in meson
- Not recommended unless elimination proves too difficult

#### 1.2 Complete meson.build
- Fix pth_p.h handling (from 1.1)
- Generate pth.h from pth.h.in (configure version numbers)
- Generate pthread.h from pthread.h.in if needed
- Ensure all 26 pth_*.c files compile
- Add proper install targets for headers and libraries
- Configure pkg-config file

#### 1.3 Remove Autotools
- Delete: configure, configure.ac, Makefile.in, Makefile.am
- Delete: aclocal.m4, libtool.m4, config.guess, config.sub
- Delete: shtool, install-sh, compile, depcomp
- Keep: README, COPYING, INSTALL (update content), documentation

### Phase 2: C17 Modernization

#### 2.1 Basic Code Cleanup
- Replace all `intern` → `static` (71 instances, can use sed)
- Add missing `#include` directives for implicit declarations
- Use stdint.h types consistently (int32_t, uint64_t, etc.)
- Fix function prototypes to be complete and correct
- Add `(void)` to unused parameters systematically

#### 2.2 Remove Non-Linux Compatibility
- Remove platform checks for FreeBSD 3.x, Solaris, AIX, IRIX, etc.
- Remove workarounds for ancient glibc versions
- Assume modern Linux syscalls are available
- Simplify pth_mctx.c to modern Linux only
- Remove HAVE_* checks for universally available features

#### 2.3 Fix All Compiler Warnings
- Work through clang-tidy warnings systematically
- Fix implicit function declarations
- Add braces around single-statement if/else/for/while
- Remove unused variables and functions
- Fix magic numbers (define constants)
- Address cognitive complexity issues

### Phase 3: Test Suite Modernization

#### 3.1 Eliminate User Interaction
- Review all 11 tests for interactive prompts/waits
- test_httpd: already fixed ✓
- Add timeouts to all tests
- Make tests exit automatically on completion/timeout
- Remove any scanf/getchar/pause calls

#### 3.2 Expand Test Coverage
- Context switching stress tests
- Signal handling tests
- Thread synchronization tests
- Event system edge cases
- Error handling paths
- Target: >70% code coverage

#### 3.3 Automate Testing
- Enable all tests in meson.build with test()
- Set reasonable timeouts (30-60 seconds)
- Create test wrapper that runs all tests
- Consider valgrind/sanitizer integration

### Phase 4: API Behavioral Verification

#### 4.1 Document & Test Current Behavior
- Review pth.pod and other documentation
- Create tests that prove current API semantics
- Test thread scheduling algorithm behavior
- Test event system behavior
- Test error conditions and errno values

#### 4.2 Regression Testing
- Run original tests (from old build) vs new build
- Compare outputs and behaviors
- Verify errno handling is identical
- Test signal mask handling
- Test edge cases match original

### Phase 5: Final Polish

#### 5.1 Documentation Updates
- Update README for meson/ninja build instructions
- Remove references to old platforms from all docs
- Document modern Linux requirements (kernel, glibc versions)
- Update INSTALL guide completely
- Clean up PORTING (focus on modern systems only)

#### 5.2 Code Quality
- Remove obsolete comments about old platforms
- Add explanatory comments for complex algorithms
- Document thread safety considerations
- Remove dead code
- Simplify where possible without breaking API

## Iterative Working Process

### How to Use This Process

The user can invoke this iterative process by saying:
- "Perform the next iteration"
- "Do next work unit"
- "Continue modernization"
- "Next iteration please"

### Iteration Steps

Each iteration follows this cycle:

#### Step 1: ASSESS
- Read AGENTS.md current status section
- Check build status: `ninja -C builddir 2>&1 | head -50`
- Review recent git changes: `git status`, `git diff --stat`
- Identify the highest priority blocker or next task from plan
- Check if we're approaching context limits (monitor conversation length)

#### Step 2: WORK
- Select ONE focused unit of work (typically 30-60 minutes of effort)
- Work should be:
  - **Atomic**: Can be completed and tested in one iteration
  - **Testable**: Can verify it works before moving on
  - **Committable**: Results in a valid git commit
- Examples of work units:
  - Extract declarations from 3-5 source files
  - Replace all `intern` with `static` and test
  - Fix compilation errors in one subsystem
  - Make one test non-interactive
  - Remove one category of autotools files
- Prefer smaller units over larger ones
- Test the change works before proceeding

#### Step 3: UPDATE
- Update this AGENTS.md file:
  - Move completed items from plan to "Recently Completed"
  - Update blocker status if changed
  - Update statistics if relevant
  - Add new blockers if discovered
  - Update "Current Work" section below
- Commit the work: `git add -A && git commit -m "descriptive message"`
- Report to user what was done and what's next

#### Step 4: REPEAT OR PAUSE
- If approaching context limits: Update AGENTS.md and tell user to start new conversation
- If blocker encountered: Update AGENTS.md, report to user, await guidance
- If iteration successful: Ready for next iteration
- If phase complete: Celebrate, update AGENTS.md, move to next phase

### Context Limit Handling

When approaching context limits (~80% of conversation):
1. Ensure AGENTS.md is fully updated with all progress
2. Commit all changes
3. Tell user: "Approaching context limits. Please start a new conversation and say 'perform the next iteration' to continue."
4. User can then use `/clear` and resume with fresh context

## Notes for AI Agents

- Always read this file first when resuming work
- Update this file after each work iteration
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Test after each change before proceeding
- When in doubt, prefer smaller incremental changes
- Preserve API compatibility above all else
- Modern Linux means: kernel 4.0+, glibc 2.28+, as of 2020
- Focus on one blocker at a time
- Keep build in working state when possible
